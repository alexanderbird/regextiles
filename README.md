## Developer Notes

It's just a single HTML file with one JavaScript file and one CSS file,
according to the ancient traditions of the interwebs.

To preview locally, clone the repo and open the HTML file in your browser.

That's it.

## Alternatives

I didn't do a web search before making this, but apparently someone else had the
same idea years ago, and also named theirs "regextris" ðŸ˜®. I did not mean to
take the same name.

I'll probably rename mine to something else.
