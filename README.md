## Developer Notes

It's just a single HTML file with one JavaScript file and one CSS file,
according to the ancient traditions of the interwebs.

That's it.

## Prior art

I didn't do a web search before making this, but apparently someone else had the
same idea years ago, and also named theirs "regextris" ðŸ˜®. I did not mean to
take the same name.

Their site was hosted on Heroku but doesn't appear to be operational any more.
Also, the last update was 4+ years ago.

If you were part of that project (or any other same-named project) and would
prefer I didn't use the name, you can open an issue on this repo and I'll change
the name to something else.
